# City Random Walk Simulation üèôÔ∏èüé≤

**Description:**  
This Python project simulates the random movement of people in a city. Each person takes a series of steps influenced by dice rolls, which can move them forward, backward, or with a random jump. The project demonstrates core concepts from Python including lists, dictionaries, loops, conditionals, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

## Features
- Customizable city with houses, population, and area
- Random walk simulation for multiple people
- Visualization of individual paths and distribution of final positions
- Statistical summary of house areas and population positions

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `city_walk.py` with Python 3.x.
3. Observe the printed statistics and the plots.
4. Modify city parameters, number of steps, or random walk rules to explore different scenarios.
